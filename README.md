Implementing A level physics as Haskell modules

## What is this?

This is a repository for the code that goes along with a series on the [blog](http://pcwizz.net "pcwizz.net"). The series is aimed at revising A level physics by using the equations to learn the Haskell programming language. If this sounds interesting to you [click here to go to the series](http://pcwizz.net/article.php?series_id=3 "Physics through Haskell").

## Found a Problem
